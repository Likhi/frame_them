# frame_them
 Detect eyes and calculate number of faces.

# What is this?

Baby's first face detection tutorial.

# Maybe run these

python -m venv .venv (if it fails, then run it again, maybe throw on a sudo or try PowerShell)

.\.venv\scripts\activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Then, definitely run this:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Now what?

Run the script using: python frame_them.py <haar cascade path>

# Anything else?

No.
